Set a rack on a sheet pan in the oven. Whisk the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, sugar, paprika and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside. Shear the corn kernels from the cob with a knife. Working over a bowl, run a knife along the cob to press out the milky liquid. Puree half the corn with the milk in a small food processor. Add the 2 tablespoons butter and the egg yolk and pulse until evenly combined. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry. Whip the egg white in a medium bowl until it almost holds a medium-stiff peak. Lightly fold the egg white into the batter. Heat a griddle or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add 1 teaspoon of the remaining butter. Drop heaping tablespoons of the batter into the pan and cook until golden brown on the bottom and little bubbles break the surface of each pancake, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook the corn cakes on the other side until lightly brown. Serve immediately or transfer to the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter. To assemble: Toss the duck confit in the BBQ Sauce to coat. Top each corn cake with about 1 tablespoon BBQ'd Duck Confit. Serve. Copyright 2005 Television Food Network, G.P.
