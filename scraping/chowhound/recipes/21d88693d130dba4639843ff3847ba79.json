Creamy mascarpone, almond extract, cinnamon, and honey are thinned out with milk to the perfect consistency for dipping an array of fresh, seasonal fruit—try cherries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, and blackberries in summer, and sliced apples, pears, and grapes in the fall. Basically, you can set this out at parties and potlucks all year long, and it’ll always be a hit, especially if you add some graham crackers and shortbread cookies to the mix of dippers.\n\nNote: Feel free to play around a bit with the ingredients. Substitute vanilla extract for the almond extract, and/or try maple syrup instead of honey for slightly different flavors.","totalTime":5,"ingredients":["8 ounces mascarpone cheese","1 teaspoon almond extract","1 teaspoon ground cinnamon","2 tablespoons honey","3 tablespoons whole milk"],"directions":["In a small bowl, whisk together the mascarpone, almond extract, cinnamon, honey, and milk.
